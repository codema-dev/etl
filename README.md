## Why?

In previous years all data wrangling was performed solely using `Microsoft Excel`.   Although this is useful for small datasets, it soon becomes a burden when working with multiple, large datasets.

For example, when generating the previous residential energy estimates it was necessary to create up to 16 separate workbooks for each local authority each containing as many as 15 sheets, as the datasets were too large to fit into a single workbook.  Although each workbook performed the same logic to clean and merge datasets, changing this logic meant changing all of the separate workbooks one at a time.

Moving to open-source scripting tools enabled using logic written down in scripts (or text files) to wrangle and merge data files, thus separating data from the logic operating on it.  This means that if any dataset is updated, re-generating outputs is as simple as running a few scripts.  Furthermore these scripts can be shared without sharing the underlying datasets.

## Tools Considered

**Criteria:**  a tool capable of modelling retrofitting hundreds of thousands of buildings to estimate energy & carbon savings, BER rating improvement and costs.  

[`EnergyPLAN`](https://www.energyplan.eu/) is an energy system model that works well for comparing aggregated demand against renewable supply profiles.  It doesn't, however, model individual buildings and instead requires aggregated inputs for building energy demands.

SEAI's [Dwelling Energy Assessment Procedure (`DEAP`)](https://www.seai.ie/home-energy/building-energy-rating-ber/) Excel model, [`EnergyPlus`](https://energyplus.net/) and [`RC_BuildingSimulator`](https://github.com/architecture-building-systems/RC_BuildingSimulator) can model individual buildings using simple physics-based simulations but are difficult to scale.  As a result, it is necessary to create a limited number of representative archetypes (<100) in order to use them to model building stocks.  At present, archetype creation for these models is a long, manual process.  To avoid this limitation some scripting libraries were experimented with to see if this process could be sped up:

- `DEAP`: [`pycel`](https://github.com/dgorissen/pycel) enables replacing individual building characteristics specified in a `DEAP` `Excel` model via a `Python` process, however, as of January 2020 `pycel` library didn't support all operations performed in the `DEAP` spreadsheet.

- `EnergyPlus`: [`eppy`](https://github.com/santoshphilip/eppy) enables replacing building characteristics and [`geomeppy`](https://github.com/jamiebull1/geomeppy) geometry-specific characteristics via `Python`. As of September 2020 these libraries are better suited to parameterising existing models than for creating them from scratch.

`RC_BuildingSimulator` is a `Python` library and so can be easily scaled. This library wasn't used as it is not actively maintained, cumbersome to adapt to this use case and would require some validation as to its accuracy as it is not a widely used library.       

[`CityEnergyAnalyst`](https://cityenergyanalyst.com/) also models individual buildings using physics-based simulations but is designed for district-level simulations.  However, it is tied to `Openstreetmaps` as a data source for building geometries and ages and to swiss building standards by building age for archetypes.  As of October 2020 `Openstreetmaps` was not as complete as in Switzerland, and decoupling `CityEnergyAnalyst` from it proved difficult.   

| Tool | Barrier |
| --- | --- |
| `EnergyPLAN` | Modelling building energy demands |
| `DEAP` | Scaling building energy demands |
| `EnergyPlus` | "" |
| `RC_BuildingSimulator` | Adaptation & validation for the Dublin building stock |
| `CityEnergyAnalyst` | Poor data quality for Dublin buildings |

As a consequence, we developed `rc-building-model` which re-implements the `DEAP` model in `Python`.  This model was tested and validated against the `DEAP` `Excel` model for individual buildings, and implemented to easily and rapidly scale to the Dublin building stock.

## Keeping the global `environment.yml` up to date

This `environment.yml` is built by merging the `environment.yml` from each project.  `Binder` & `GitPod` use it to create a sandbox environment in which all dependencies are installed.

To update this file run:

```bash
conda env create --file environment.meta.yml --name codema-dev-projects-meta
conda activate codema-dev-projects-meta
invoke merge-environment-ymls
```

> `conda env create` creates a virtual environment by reading `environment.meta.yml` in which `invoke` is defined as a dependency.  `invoke` then runs the function `merge_environment_ymls` from `tasks.py` which merges the `environment.yml` from each project and from `environment.meta.yml` together into a single `environment.yml` 

To speed up `Binder` builds, `Binder` reads the `codema-dev/projects` dependencies from a separate repository [codema-dev/projects-sandbox](https://github.com/codema-dev/projects-sandbox).  You must also update the `environment.yml` here with your newly generated `environment.yml` to keep `Binder` up to date!

> Every time any file is changed `Binder` rebuilds the entire repository and reinstalls the dependencies.  By keeping the environment and the content separate `Binder` only reinstalls dependencies when the dependencies change.  This means that it no longer has to download & resolve dependency conflicts which can take ~20 minutes.
